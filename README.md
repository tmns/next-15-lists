# Just Lists

Literally, justs lists.

Small app for experimenting with NextJS 15, actions, Convex, shadcn, etc. Changes can come at any time!

Demo [here](https://next-15-lists.vercel.app).

_Note, the currently deployed branch is the `convex` branch, because the UX is substantially better than just plain NextJS actions. If you want the plain NextJS version, you'll need to run it locally._
